##Ads Click prediction using Machine Learning
### Problem Statement
We have a advertising dataset of a marketing agency. Goal is to develop a ML algorithm that predicts if a particular user will click on an advertisement. The dataset has 10 features:

'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Male', 'Country', Timestamp' 'Clicked on Ad'.

'Clicked on Ad' is the categorical target feature, which has two possible values: 0 (user didn't click) and 1(user clicked).
